Hi!, My Name is Andy Jenkins and I live in Stoke-on-Trent, I finally launched cloudallthethings, my own built and maintained blog in 2020!.  It's something I had been considering on and off for the last 8+ years but never got around to making it happen.  So why now?.  I have always wanted a place where I can post my learnings on the various technologies that I am fortunate to use and I often find myself having to re-create and re-learn activities over again, so having a place to store my learning guides, troubleshooting findings and general hints and tips that I pick up as a Cloud Solution Architect made more sense than ever before.

Also, if the content I create is of use to others in this fantastic community that I am part of then that can only be a win-win.  I have always prided myself as being someone who wants to help others and hopefully this can be of use!.

<span style="color:#2196F3"> **Who Am I?** </span> - I have over 22 years experience in the IT industry across multiple industries mostly in customer facing, technical lead roles focussing on solution and cloud architecture. I have been incredibly lucky to work for some of the industries biggest and most innovate companies, including IBM, VMware, Microsoft and since July 2019 back at VMware again!.

!!! My passion in recent years has been around Cloud Technologies (thus the name of my blog), initially Azure where I worked @ Microsoft as a Principle Cloud Solution Architect for 3.5 years and more recently in my role within the Emerging Cloud Technologies team @ VMware which has also given me the opportunity to gain experience with AWS and Google Cloud and how customers operate IT in this complex and ever growing environment.

<span style="color:#2196F3"> **What I do?** </span> - I currently work as a Staff Cloud Solution Architect within the Emerging Cloud Technologies team @ VMware, I am responsible for positioning VMware solutions across the major hyper-scale cloud vendors as well as helping my customers navigate an ever changing hybrid and multi-cloud world through automation, Infrastructure as Code, Dev/Ops and enabling new cloud operating models.

I have also spent time gaining experience in understanding CI/CD workflows, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and as VMware brings Tanzu and Pacific to the market, I am also starting to get more hands on with Kubernetes.
